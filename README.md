### Project Overview
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the use of DAX to build powerful visualizations that will help Atlas Labs understand and address employee attrition. 
- Attrition, or employee turnover, refers to employees leaving the organization, whether voluntarily or involuntarily.

The leadership team at Atlas Labs seeks high-level insights into their workforce, with a particular focus on understanding the factors influencing employee attrition. In addition to attrition analysis, this study also looks into HR metrics related to diversity and inclusion, marital status, and ethnicity. Furthermore, the HR team requested a performance tracking system to continually monitor individual employee performance based on annual performance reviews.

### Tools

- Excel
- Powerbi

### Project Objectives
The goal of this analysis is to:

1. Identify the factors contributing to employee attrition.
2. Provide a deep dive into employee demographics to identify potential issues related to diversity, inclusion, and other HR metrics.
3. Offer a system to track employee performance over time, enabling managers and HR to monitor and take proactive measures when necessary.

### Methodology
- Step 1: Data Import and Preparation
  - Data Sources: Imported five CSV files related to employee information, attrition, performance, and demographics into Power BI.
  - Fact and Dimension Tables: Labeled and organized the data by creating Fact and Dimension tables to streamline the analysis.
  - Data Formatting: Reviewed the tables to ensure each column was correctly formatted and assigned the appropriate data types.

- Step 2: Date Table Creation
  - Created a Date Table to ensure accurate reporting of date and time-related metrics. This table was used to handle any time-based calculations such as performance reviews and hire/exit dates.
  
- Step 3: Managing Table Relationships
  - Managed relationships between the fact and dimension tables, ensuring that the data is connected properly to allow for seamless cross-referencing in visualizations.

- Step 4: Measures Table
  - Created an empty table to store all measures used throughout the analysis. This allows for cleaner organization of custom calculations, particularly when using DAX to generate insights.
